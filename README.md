fsndp1
======

Python project to generate a list of movies with movie posters and links to their trailers.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Starting with entertainment_center.py you will be asked for input in a terminal window - Do you want to see my favorite movies (type 'm'), or search for your favorite movies (type 's')?

If you search for your favorite, you will be given another option to input movie title keywords, for example, "star wars".

A search will be done using The Movie Database (TMDb)'s API.  As each matching movie is found, the terminal will output the name.  The most popular will be used to generate a browser window (in a new tab) displaying the title with a movie poster which is linked to a popout YouTube trailer video.

For more information on the API, see [TMDb API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).
